        "Features": "The LV-WX300UST features ultra-short throw capability at a close proximity of 28.2cm while projecting images as large as 80-inch. Given this unique ability, installation options are greatly flexible since the projector can be installed just above the screen, thus minimising shadow casted by the presenter. The LV-WX300UST is apt for usage in tight spaces or even at shopfronts for aesthetic display.",
